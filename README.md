# Real Time Bus Tracker
Alice Geus
March 6th, 2023

### Description:

Real time tracking of the busses in the Metro Phoenix area.  At the moment, it just shows the locations of the first twenty busses.  The program refreshes every fifteen seconds and shows where the busses have moved.


### How to run:

Enter your mapbox API key in the mapanimation.js file, then open up index.html.


### Roadmap of future improvements:

In the future, I'd like to add a method to search for a street and see all busses that are on that street at the moment, or maybe search for a bus stop and see where the next bus is on it's way to that stop.  Possibly add methods to filter for certain busses, search by bus number, route, directions, etc.
